!!!Note
    Stopping a workspace will save its state, so you can resume later without losing your progress.


### Restarting a Gitpod Workspace

1. **Open Gitpod Dashboard:**
Once you're in the Gitpod dashboard, navigate to the "Workspaces" section. In the "Workspaces" section, you will see a list of your current and past workspaces. Locate the workspace you want to restart. Stopped workspaces will have an indicator showing they are not running.
