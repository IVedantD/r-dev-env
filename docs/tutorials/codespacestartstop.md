#### How to Restart Codespaces again?

 > The code changes and operations we have performed inside the codespace will still be inside the stopped codespace. Also, the codespace may have an inactivity time limit and close after 30 minutes. If your codespace is stopped then you can restart it as shown below.


- Go to [github.com/codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces)
- Here we can see a list of the codespaces we have created
