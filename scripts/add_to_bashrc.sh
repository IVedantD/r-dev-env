Welcome to the Containerised R Development Environment

Here you can modify, compile and use R as described in
the r development guide:
    https://contributor.r-project.org/rdevguide/GetStart.html#building-r


To help you, we have already set the following environment variables:

BUILDDIR = \"$BUILDDIR\"

Have fun :)
